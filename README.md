# Graph Data-Structure
This repository contains my solutions for common graph data structure problems and implementation of Data Structures in Cpp.
I've created this repository to learn about algorithms. I am adding solutions continuously.   

## Problems:

1. Breadth First Search (BFS)
2. Depth First Search (DFS)
3. Detect cycle in a directed graph
4. Detect cycle in an undirected graph
5. Topological sort.cpp
